BLACKJACK VERSION 1.0
ALLAN LAVELL
------------
REQUIREMENTS:

- To run the game, you need to have python (python.org) and pygame (pygame.org) installed.

HOW TO RUN:

LINUX
- Open up a terminal, cd to this directory, and type

python blackjack.py

WINDOWS
- Double click on the file blackjack.py

- Open up a console, cd to this directory, and type

blackjack.py

- An alternate method to run the game follows. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the folder where blackjack.py
resides, right-click blackjack.py, and select "Edit With IDLE". Click on the window that has just popped up
that contains the code, and hit F5 to run it.

**NOTE: Exiting the program often doesn't go well with IDLE, and the whole thing will probably freeze up,
then crash. This causes no harm, but it's extremely annoying. Therefore, I recommend running the game from the
command line, where no such errors occur.

DOCUMENTATION: 

- The documentation included with this project is in the "docs" folder, in the form of a PDF file.

This game won first place in the Dalhousie University High School Programming Competition. Yay! :D
